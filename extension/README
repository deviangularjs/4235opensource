SearchMark
==========

When you are looking for a page you once bookmarked, but just can't find it anymore, SearchMark can help. The SearchMark Google Chrome Extension allows you to search your bookmarked pages, and we don't mean just the page title or its cryptic web address, but the page contents as well! SearchMark even makes bookmark management a breeze: no more sorting into folders; simply add the bookmark and search it using SearchMark!

After installation, the extension will download and index all your bookmarked pages. At anytime, click on the SearchMark icon in the toolbar to open and use the search page. Later, every time you add, remove, or change a bookmark the index will get updated and so will your search.

Authors: Akshay Dua (http://github.com/daku), Candy Yiu (http://github.com/cheta), and Doug Hughes (http://blog.alagad.com/, http://alagad.com/). We would like to thank Doug Hughes for suggesting many new features, teaching us a lot through his own bookmark search extension, and agreeing to merge extensions (both, interestingly, called SearchMark).

A note on excessive permissions:

At the time of installation, a permission box pops up saying that this extension has access to all your data on all your web sites. We certainly don't want *any* of your data, and do not need access to all your web sites. The only permissions we need, is for the extension to download your bookmarked pages. It seems the extension mechanism does not provide us with a way to get these permissions without asking for the whole enchilada of permissions. We apologize for requesting such wide permissions, but assure you that our extension does not in any way read, use, or communicate any of your personal information. Further, bookmarked web sites are downloaded to *only* your machine, and from addresses that you have already provided as part of the bookmarked information.

Our extension is open source under the terms of the GNU GPL license. Please feel free to browse through our extension source code at http://github.com/daku/SearchMark to verify its data access requirements.

Extension Architecture
======================

The extension has a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is the
user interface and the back-end is the core search functionality like
indexing and search. The main technology used by the
extension is HTML5 SQLite databases (to store the bookmarks and their
page contents). SQLite has virtual tables that provide a full-text
index for table contents. We simply download a user's bookmarked pages
into a virtual table, and use standard SQL search queries to look for
keywords input by the user.

Extension Files:

* For the back-end
** background.html: [Initialize] Add bookmarks and associated page 
contents to database on first use. [Manage] Add, remove, or update 
bookmarks in this database as when the user does the same. [Search]
given a set of keywords from the UI, search the database for them.

* For the UI
** images
** SearchMarkUI.html
** rawPageView.html (to display stored html pages)

* General 
** manifest.json: mandatory permission file for all Google chrome 
extensions
